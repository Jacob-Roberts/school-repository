    <p>
        Orangutan is not spelled with a G at the end, contrary to popular belief
    </p>

    <p>
        Orangutans arms are so long, they can scratch their ankles without bending over.
    </p>

    <p>
        Orangutans are mammals
    </p>

    <p>
        The word Orangutan comes from the malay word for "human of the forest"
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though they could be carnivores, and become the real king of the forest, they choose to eat only fruits
        and leaves
